## NazareAI’s Presentation Structure

NazareAI's presentation system provides a structured format for creating presentations using a markup-based approach. This format is designed to be both human-readable and easily parseable by machines, making it ideal for developers building presentation tools and extensions.

## Core Structure

Every presentation is wrapped in global markers:

```
nazareai_ppt_fce
[presentation content]
end_nazareai_ppt_fce
```

Individual slides are marked with sequential identifiers:

```
nazareai_ppt_slide_1:
[slide content]
nazareai_ppt_slide_2:
[slide content]
```

## Slide Components

### Required Components

* `<headline>`: The main title of the slide (required for every slide)

### Optional Components

* `<subheadline>`: Secondary heading or subtitle
* `<text>`: Main body text content
* `<emphasis>`: Highlighted text (typically shown at bottom)
* `<list>`: Bullet point items
* `<table>`: Structured tabular data

## Component Details

### Text Formatting

* Plain text is rendered as-is
* Bold text uses double asterisks: `**bold text**`
* Line breaks in lists: use `<br/>`

### Lists

Lists are defined using the `<list>` tag with bullet points:

```
<list>
• First item
• Second item
• Third item with **bold text**
</list>
```

### Tables

Tables use markdown-style syntax within `<table>` tags:

```
<table>
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1-1  | Row 1-2  | Row 1-3  |
| Row 2-1  | Row 2-2  | Row 2-3  |
</table>
```

## Example

Here's a complete example of a presentation with one slide using all available components:

```
nazareai_ppt_fce
nazareai_ppt_slide_1:
<headline>Main Presentation Title</headline>
<subheadline>Supporting Information</subheadline>
<text>This is the main content of the slide explaining key points.</text>
<list>
• First important point
• Second point with **emphasized text**
